| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Change app name | Changes the app name shown under the launcher icon. Set the desired name in the patch options. | • App name |
| Change package name | Changes the app package name so the patched app installs alongside the original Threads. Set the desired package name in the patch options. WARNING: Meta apps hardcode many component/provider references — renaming the package can break Facebook login (SSO), content providers, or push. Disable this patch if you hit such issues. | • Package name |
| Hide ads | Removes sponsored posts from the Threads feed by filtering ad feed units (detected via Media.DED) out of the list merged into the feed cache, before they can render. Feed-scoped; other surfaces (clips/reels) are not affected. |  |
| Remove AD_ID permission | Removes the advertising-id (AD_ID) permissions so the device advertising id cannot be read for ad tracking. Does not disable Meta's core analytics. |  |
