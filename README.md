### FAQ

- **What is supported?** Use the versions, version codes, ABI, and APK/APKM format in the generated patch catalog and [validation guide](docs/validation.md); unlisted versions are not compatibility claims.
- **Can I repatch an installed app?** No. Start with the supported original APK/APKM; refreshing the source only updates patch metadata.
- **Why can sign-in or Drive fail?** Package/certificate-bound services and provider authorization are external boundaries. MicroG support does not guarantee Google sign-in or Drive access. See the [Zalo microG/Drive troubleshooting guide](docs/zalo-microg.md).
- **Why does Zalo still say MicroG is missing?** The provider must be enabled and use the exact package `app.revanced.android.gms`; Android package visibility can also hide an installed provider. The patch now declares that package and opens the official [Morphe MicroG download page](https://morphe.software/microg). Details and issue references are in the [guide](docs/zalo-microg.md).
- **How should I report a failure?** Include the app version code, bundle version, selected patches/options, and redacted logs. Never attach credentials, account data, signing keys, or proprietary APKs.

**🎯 Supported versions:**

| 26.08.01 |
| :---: |

| 💊&nbsp;Patch | 📜&nbsp;Description | ⚙️&nbsp;Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Bypass native startup tamper check | Preserves native key initialization and NOPs only the JNI System.exit dispatch in the pinned arm64 26.08.01 build. |  |
| Change Zalo app name | Changes the name shown for Zalo under the launcher icon. Set the desired name in the patch options. | • App name |
| Change Zalo package name | Changes Zalo's package name so a clone can be installed beside stock Zalo, including package-owned provider references used after login. WARNING: package- and certificate-bound login, push, sharing, deep links, and backup may not work with the renamed application. | • Package name |
| Disable ads | Disables Zalo offline/Google ad networks (forces the Adtima offline gates closed, always drops admob/dfp/ima, and reports limit-ad-tracking opted-out). Sponsored Story/community placements need the companion patch. |  |
| Disable sponsored placements | Forces Zalo Story/community ad-enable flags to off at their config reads (normal content path kept). Server-stitched or OA-message promos may remain. |  |
| Disable telemetry and crash reporting | Stops Zalo's first-party analytics records and diagnostic crash data by suppressing its Room analytics writes, Firebase Crashlytics logs/keys, and native crash-handler registration. Messaging, sockets, and database initialization remain intact. |  |
| Enable Google Drive photo backup | Enables Zalo's existing Google Drive photo-backup option. It does not bypass Google authorization, server retention, encryption, or media exclusions. |  |
| Filter promo notifications | Skips Zalo Timeline/Stories and Zalo Video push notifications (like/comment digests, new feeds/stories, video reminders) in the push dispatcher. Message, call, friend-request and birthday notifications are untouched; reaction/activity pushes on other channels may remain. |  |
| Hide Business Box | Removes Zalo's Business Box service entry from the main chat list without filtering ordinary conversations or user-initiated Official Account chats. |  |
| Keep expired media accessible | Keeps locally stored large chat media usable after Zalo's client-side expiry window by bypassing the expired/subscription state. It does not restore missing files or bypass server download authorization. |  |
| Prefer original photo quality | Enables Zalo's existing original-quality photo path by default. It does not change server upload limits, account restrictions, or video handling. |  |
| Remove AD_ID permission | Removes the advertising-id (AD_ID) permissions from Zalo so the device advertising id cannot be read for ad tracking. In-app readers fall back to "unknown"; core messaging is unaffected. |  |
| Remove media backup age limit | Includes media of any age in Zalo's existing Google Drive backup/restore pipeline. It does not bypass Drive retention or media exclusions. |  |
| Suppress outbound seen status | Stops Zalo from sending seen-status packets without changing message delivery or incoming status rendering. |  |
| Suppress outbound typing status | Stops Zalo from sending typing indicators. Incoming status rendering and messages remain unchanged. |  |
| microG Drive support | Adds Zalo launch/provider checks and redirects Google Drive account selection and token binding to microG-RE (app.revanced / app.revanced.android.gms). Initial photo restore and the complete backup/restore cycle were device-validated on Zalo 26.08.01. |  |

| Hide ads | Removes sponsored posts from the Threads feed by filtering ad feed units (detected via Media.DED/DGK) out of the list merged into the feed cache, before they can render. Feed-scoped; other surfaces (clips/reels) are not affected. |  |
| Remove AD_ID permission | Removes the advertising-id (AD_ID) permissions so the device advertising id cannot be read for ad tracking. Does not disable Meta's core analytics. |  |
