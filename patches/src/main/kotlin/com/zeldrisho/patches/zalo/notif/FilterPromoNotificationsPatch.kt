/**
 * Skips Zalo Timeline/Stories and Zalo Video push notifications in the push
 * dispatcher (`Lpy/i;.j0()`).
 *
 * Each promo arm loads its channel enum and jumps to the shared post path
 * (`sget …; goto :goto_4`). The patch replaces that single jump with
 * `return-void`, so the notification is never built or posted. The edit is
 * one instruction for one instruction, so offsets and any try ranges are
 * preserved.
 *
 * Suppressed (verified type map, see batch2-evidence.md §1): like/comment and
 * story-reaction digests, new feeds/stories, missed-feed digests, story
 * archive pushes, profile-music and dating ("zinder") pushes, Zalo Video
 * reminders — all of which the dispatcher routes to SOCIAL_STORY/ZALO_VIDEO.
 *
 * Limits: message, call, friend-request/accept, birthday and other channels
 * are untouched. Engagement pushes routed elsewhere (chat/group reactions via
 * ACTIVITY_UPDATES, phone-number friend suggestions via ALERT) still show;
 * the server can also introduce new push types at any time.
