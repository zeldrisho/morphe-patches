/**
 * Hides sponsored posts from the Threads feed.
 *
 * Approach (issue #5): the previous implementation forced `Media.DED() -> false`,
 * which only stripped the "Ad"/"Sponsored" chrome while leaving the ad post in the
 * feed (the reporter's exact symptom: "labels disappeared but ads still show").
 * On-device probing (434.0.0.41.74 / versionCode 510406926) showed the main feed
 * has no ad-specific construction hook — ads are ordinary feed units whose ONLY ad
 * signal is `Media.DED()` (consulted thousands of times per feed scroll), and every
 * fetched list funnels through `BarcelonaFeedCache.A0F`.
 *
 * So instead of relabeling, we drop DED-true units from the list BEFORE it merges
 * into the visible feed: `FeedAdFilter.filterAds()` (companion extension) inspects
 * each unit via reflection (media `A05()/DED()`, or thread-carried items
 * `A02() -> Ckh() -> CDh() -> DED()`), and this patch replaces the feed-list
 * parameter with the filtered result at the top of A0F.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Feed-scoped: sponsored units in other surfaces (clips/reels/stories) are
 *    unaffected.
 *  - `DED()` is left natural so the filter can see real ads.
 *  - Any reflection mismatch degrades to a no-op (no crash), so an app update
 *    worst-case brings ads back instead of breaking the feed.
