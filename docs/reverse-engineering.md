# Reverse engineering workflow

How to go from an APK file to a working patch in this repo.
Fingerprint authoring is covered in the [patch development](patch-development.md) guide.

## Pipeline

```
RECON → DECOMPILE → HUNT → WRITE → TEST
```

| Stage | Question | Output |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Recon | What app is this? | Identity + protections + framework notes |
| Decompile | What does it do? | `decompiled/` (jadx Java) + `smali/` (apktool) |
| Hunt | Where is the check? | Smali-verified target (class, method, instruction sequence) |
| Write | How to bypass it? | `Fingerprints.kt` + `*Patch.kt` under `patches/src/main/kotlin/com/zeldrisho/patches/<app>/` |
| Test | Does it match? | `./gradlew buildAndroid`, then apply the `.mpp` in Morphe |

## Analysis workspace

Analysis lives in the gitignored `analysis/<app>/<version>/` workspace. Keep APKs
in `apk/`, JADX output in `decompiled/`, standalone smali in `smali/`, recovered
names in `mapping/`, evidence in `notes/`, and disposable experiments in
`runs/<run-name>/`. Apktool's complete project belongs in `decoded/` (usually
`decoded/base/`); its `smali*` directories are not a separate top-level workspace.
Keep split inputs together. Record version code, ABI, source URL, and SHA-256 in
`notes/recon.md`; never commit analysis inputs or outputs or put secrets, account
data, or tokens in notes or logs. `<analysis>` below refers to this workspace.

To preview deletion of the entire workspace:

```bash
python3 scripts/clean_analysis.py --analysis --dry-run
```

Only remove it after preserving needed evidence:

```bash
python3 scripts/clean_analysis.py --analysis
```

Cleanup removes the whole directory, including notes and runs.

## Tools

See [toolchain setup](toolchain.md) for the complete inventory and install
commands, including fish PATH setup and the `uv tool` versus `uvx` decision.
The Morphe CLI applies `.mpp` bundles; `scripts/repatch.py` finds the Morphe
JAR in its standard locations with no setup.

`scripts/apk_recon.py` wraps the recon step (archive metadata, selected
framework markers, native-library paths, `aapt` metadata, and optional `apkid`
output); `scripts/extract_smali.py` wraps the
DEX → smali step (including split `.apkm`/`.xapk` handling);
`scripts/hunt_signals.py <decompiled|smali>` counts protection/billing/ads/Ktor/Koin
signals in one pass before hunting; `scripts/recover_kotlin_names.py <decompiled>`
rebuilds obfuscated → real Kotlin class names from `@DebugMetadata`/`@Metadata`.

## Recon

Get the original split bundle only from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/).
Record the download page URL and input SHA-256 alongside versionCode and ABI.
Run `scripts/apk_recon.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/apk_recon.py <analysis>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm
```

Manual equivalent:

1. `aapt dump badging <apk>` — package, version, versionCode, SDK levels, label, launch activity.
2. `aapt dump xmltree <apk> AndroidManifest.xml | rg -i 'split|requiredSplit'` — split-APK detection.
   For `.apkm`/`.xapk`, extract `base.apk` to a temp dir first and run `aapt` on that.
3. `uvx apkid <apk>` — compiler, obfuscator, packer, anti-debug, anti-VM (per DEX / lib).
4. `unzip -l <apk> | rg '\.dex'` — DEX count.
5. `unzip -l <apk> | rg 'index.android.bundle|libflutter|libapp'` — framework:
   `index.android.bundle` = React Native, `libflutter.so`/`libapp.so` = Flutter,
   `assets/www|public/` = Cordova/Capacitor, `libmonodroid.so|assemblies/` = Xamarin/MAUI,
   else native (Compose vs Kotlin distinguished via `androidx.compose` / `kotlin_module`
   DEX strings — `apk_recon.py` does all of this automatically).
6. Record native-lib architectures and notable permissions (billing, internet, etc.).
7. Note HTTP/DI/billing stack signals from the recon report (Retrofit/OkHttp/Ktor/Apollo,
   Hilt/Koin, RevenueCat/Adapty/Play Billing) — they pick the hunt patterns in
   [Hunt targets](#hunt-targets).

Save as `<analysis>/notes/recon.md` (rename the APK to `<app>_<version>.<ext>`).

## Decompile

```bash
jadx -d <analysis>/decompiled <analysis>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm
python3 scripts/extract_smali.py <analysis>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm <analysis>/smali
```

### JADX escalation for difficult classes

JADX is a navigation/decompilation aid, not the source of truth. When a class or
method is missing or reconstructed incorrectly, retry only the relevant input
with progressively less reconstruction:

```bash
jadx --single-class 'com.example.Target' <analysis>/<app>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm
jadx --decompilation-mode simple --no-inline-methods <analysis>/<app>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm
jadx --decompilation-mode fallback --single-class 'com.example.Target' \
  <analysis>/<app>/apk/<app>_<version>.apkm
```

Check `jadx --help` first because options vary by installed version. These
outputs are for locating callers and strings only; verify the final target in
smali from every DEX. `--raw-cfg` and `--call-graph json` are optional aids when
control flow or callers remain unclear.

### Remote decompilation for large APKs

Local jadx can OOM on large APKs:

```bash
KAGGLE_API_TOKEN=... KAGGLE_KERNEL_ID=user/jadx-apk-decompiler \
  python3 scripts/remote_decompile.py "<direct-apk-url>" <analysis>/
cd <analysis> && unzip *_decompiled.zip -d decompiled/
```

Needs the `kaggle` CLI plus a private Kaggle notebook with internet access.
The URL must be a direct download link (mirror links expire in ~1 hour — use a fresh one).

Notes:

- If you have a big machine handy, local `jadx` there works too — the rest of the
  workflow only needs the files copied back.
- `"finished with errors"` from jadx is normal for obfuscated apps. Continue as long
  as `.java` files were produced.
- Always extract smali from **all** DEX files; the class you need is often in
  `classes2.dex` or later, not `classes.dex`.

## Hunt targets

Search in a fixed order — protections first, because an integrity/root check will
break testing of everything else. Start with a one-pass triage:

```bash
python3 scripts/hunt_signals.py <analysis>/decompiled [--files]
```

`scripts/hunt_signals.py` is the canonical pattern list. The buckets below
summarize intent only; read the script for exact expressions. When a pattern
changes, update the script first, then the recipe that motivated the change in
[target-selection guidance](patch-development.md#target-selection).

- **BuildConfig sweep** (usually not obfuscated — base URLs, flavors, keys):
  search `BuildConfig.java` files for base URLs, flavors, and API keys.
  Read every hit; each Gradle module emits its own file.
- **Protections** — integrity/license, signature verification, root, pinning.
- **Billing SDK detection** — tells you which bypass recipe applies
  (RevenueCat, Adapty, Play Billing, LVL, local gates, remote config).
- **SDK-specific search** — entitlement chains, purchase queries, or local
  `isPremium`-style fallbacks.
- **Ads** — `load`/`show`/`initialize` entry points. SDK class names are stable;
  app class names are not.
- **Feature gates** — remote-config and feature-flag reads.
- **Modern Kotlin stacks** (when Retrofit patterns miss — KMP/Kotlin-only apps):
  Ktor, Apollo, Koin, and request-signing signals.

### Learning from other patch projects

Treat another project's hooks and symbol maps as candidate evidence, not a
compatibility guarantee. Runtime-hook frameworks (such as LibXposed) and Morphe
APK rewriting have different capabilities; transfer target knowledge and safety
invariants rather than copying framework infrastructure.

1. Record the reference repository revision and exact target profile. Compare
   like-for-like artifact hashes: a profile's base-APK hash must be compared with
   our extracted original `base.apk`, not the enclosing APKM or re-signed output.
   A matching versionCode alone is insufficient.
2. Independently verify candidates in our input's smali. Record owner/signature,
   semantic anchors, field relationships, callers/consumers, intended mutation,
   and regression risks in local analysis. Reject ambiguous matches; heuristic
   scores and upstream verification labels do not replace evidence.
3. Trace the state around the target. UI removal can require consistent lists,
   counts, indices, parallel arrays, adapters, and startup selection. Suppression
   should target specific branches or writes, preserving unrelated operations
   and unknown inputs rather than disabling whole subsystems.
4. Borrow negative test cases as well as intended behavior: operational alerts
   and ordinary messages must survive notification filtering, for example.
   Do not silently import the reference project's broader feature scope.
5. Distinguish fingerprint match, patch application, app launch, target-path
   execution, and observed behavior in the [validation record](validation.md).
   An installed hook or successful build does not prove the feature worked.
6. Check licensing before copying code; retain required notices for copied
   substantial portions. Remote catalogs, settings, recording, and diagnostics
   infrastructure require separate scope decisions, not automatic adoption.

For local-data features, use the [Zalo roadmap](plan.md#local-backupexport) for
feasibility and recovery requirements. Keep app-specific symbols and experimental
results in gitignored `analysis/`; do not treat private-file access as proof of
portable backup or restore.

### Recover Kotlin names for obfuscated Kotlin apps

R8 renames JVM symbols, but builds that keep `@DebugMetadata`/`@Metadata` strings
leave a trail back to the original names. (Stripped or DexGuard-style builds may
not; treat recovery coverage as best-effort.) Before tracing call flows, rebuild
the real names:

```bash
python3 scripts/recover_kotlin_names.py <analysis>/decompiled <analysis>/mapping
# → mapping.tsv / mapping.json / by_package/
```

Use the mapping to *find* classes (never to *match* — fingerprints still anchor on
SDK calls/strings/opcodes per the fingerprint reference in [patch development](patch-development.md)).
`jadx --deobf` alone is not equivalent: it invents synthetic names instead of
recovering the originals.

Obfuscation-resistant fallback: when call sites inline to `a.b(c, "…")`, grep the
path literals themselves — R8 does not obfuscate string contents:

```bash
rg -o '"(/[A-Za-z0-9_{}.\-]+(/[A-Za-z0-9_{}.\-]+)+/?)"' <analysis>/decompiled -g '*.java'
```

### Dynamic confirmation for runtime gates

Static locates, dynamic confirms. For runtime gates (pinning, root, signature,
request signing), confirm the candidate actually runs before freezing a
fingerprint. For pure static string gates (feature flags, manifest-gated ad SDK
entry points), static smali evidence alone is acceptable; dynamic confirmation
stays recommended but optional.

Prerequisites: USB debugging on, target device visible via `adb`, `frida-server`
matching the device ABI running. On a non-rooted, non-debuggable Android build,
ADB visibility alone is insufficient for Frida attach: use an early-loaded
Gadget in a disposable repackaged build instead. An integrity check may terminate
that build before an attached script runs; autonomous Gadget script mode or a
rooted `frida-server` is required for earliest hooks. Keep instrumentation builds
and signing keys outside the release pipeline. Stop with `Ctrl-C` (no device
state is modified by the hooks below). Setup lives in [toolchain setup](toolchain.md#python-applications-persistent-tools-versus-one-shot-runs).

```bash
adb devices && frida-ps -U                 # device + target process visible
frida -U -f com.target.app -l hook.js --pause   # spawn early, don't attach late
```

`--pause` leaves the main thread paused after spawning; omit it to let the app
run immediately. If the installed Frida CLI reports a different flag set, check
`frida --help` on that host before scripting it.

Minimal hooks (log first, mutate only after you see traffic):

```javascript
function bytesToHex(b) { return Array.from(new Uint8Array(b)).map(x => ('0' + (x & 0xFF).toString(16)).slice(-2)).join(''); }
// Enable only for a disposable test account; never share raw capture logs.
const CAPTURE_CRYPTO_BYTES = false;
// Cryptographic metadata only by default.
Java.perform(function() {
  Java.use("javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec").$init.overload('[B', 'java.lang.String')
    .implementation = function(k, a) {
      console.log("[key] algorithm=" + a + " bytes=" + k.length);
      if (CAPTURE_CRYPTO_BYTES) console.log("[key] raw=" + bytesToHex(k));
      return this.$init(k, a);
    };
  Java.use("javax.crypto.Cipher").doFinal.overload('[B')
    .implementation = function(b) {
      console.log("[cipher] algorithm=" + this.getAlgorithm() + " inBytes=" + b.length);
      if (CAPTURE_CRYPTO_BYTES) console.log("[cipher] in=" + bytesToHex(b));
      var r = this.doFinal(b);
      console.log("[cipher] outBytes=" + r.length);
      if (CAPTURE_CRYPTO_BYTES) console.log("[cipher] out=" + bytesToHex(r));
      return r;
    };
});
// OkHttp request / response (skip if okhttp3.* absent — R8-relocated; use TrustManager hooks instead)
Java.perform(function() {
  Java.use("okhttp3.RealCall").execute.implementation = function() {
    console.log("[http] " + this.request().method() + " " + this.request().url().toString());
    var r = this.execute(); console.log("[http] code=" + r.code()); return r;
  };
});
// Pinning triage: try one-click first, hand-roll only on failure (same command as below)
```

Order: `uvx objection --gadget com.target.app explore -s "android sslpinning disable"` → generic unpinning script
(`CertificatePinner.check` + `TrustManagerImpl.verifyChain` +
`HostnameVerifier.verify`) → hand-written hook for the app's exact class found in
[Hunt targets](#hunt-targets). If the app exits on inject, suspect anti-Frida (port/file self-check) — switch
to `frida-gadget`/Zygisk rather than grinding more static patterns. Log the
confirmed class/method/args into `notes/<topic>.md` alongside the smali quote;
a fingerprint with static smali plus one dynamic observation outlives refactors
that kill static-only guesses for runtime gates.

### Smali verification is mandatory

Never trust JADX or third-party opcode tables alone — they can mis-decompile or
misdescribe obfuscated code. The [Android bytecode specification](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dalvik-bytecode)
is authoritative for instruction formats and register limits. For every candidate:

1. Find the smali file across **all** DEX dirs: `fd --hidden --no-ignore --type f --name '<ClassName>.smali' <analysis>/smali`.
2. Read the exact method: `rg -B 2 -A 50 '\.method.*<methodName>' <file>`.
3. Record: access flags, return type (the descriptor after `)` in the method header),
   full parameter descriptors, register count, invoke sequence **in order**, and which
   DEX it came from.
4. If Java and smali disagree, **trust smali**.
5. Write the finding down (`<analysis>/notes/<topic>.md`) with the smali evidence
   quoted, plus a fingerprint strategy (which stable strings/calls to match on —
   see the fingerprint reference in [patch development](patch-development.md)). Unverified findings are not ready for patch-writing.

## Write and test the patch

The handoff from hunting is the exact smali method signature, ordered instruction
evidence, and a narrow proposed change. Record dynamic confirmation for runtime
gates; static evidence may suffice for purely static gates. Follow
[patch development](patch-development.md) for implementation and
[validation](validation.md) for build, patch, install, and device checks. A
fingerprint mismatch means return to the smali hunt; do not weaken it blindly.


# Native patching

Guidance for repository patches that modify native libraries inside split APKs.

## Safe workflow

1. Establish a stock control and record the exact version, ABI, input hash, and
   native-library hash.
2. Isolate the failure in stages: library loading, constructors, entrypoint,
   helper calls, and finally the failing predicate.
3. Preserve registration, TLS, JNI environment setup, cleanup, and normal error
   paths. Do not replace an entire initializer when only one dispatch is faulty.
4. Use a version/ABI-gated raw-resource patch with an exact original-byte guard.
   Fail closed when the library, offset, or surrounding instructions differ.
5. Test the smallest mutation first, then test it composed with the other
   patches and on a cold start.

## Diagnostics and release

Diagnostic stubs and NOPs are evidence-gathering tools, not release patches;
they may remove required initialization and create misleading secondary
crashes. A release patch should change only the verified instruction and keep
its original call context intact.

For split APKs, patch the native library in its owning ABI split and verify the
resulting signed bundle, not just an extracted `base.apk`. Record the patch
name, guarded byte pattern, ABI, signing result, runtime logs, foreground
activity, and any remaining QA limitations.
