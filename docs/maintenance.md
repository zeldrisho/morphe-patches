# Maintenance — durable project decisions

Distilled from the Threads fix (issue #5) and the 2026-09-07 tech-debt pass.
Nothing feature-specific lives here — this is how the repo is operated.

## Release home is this repo
- Ship from `zeldrisho/morphe-patches` (`dev` → release → backmerge, see
  `docs/release.md`). `scripts/repatch.sh` defaults `GITHUB_REPO` here.
- Don't split work across sibling patch repos; porting patches between repos
  duplicates fingerprint maintenance with no benefit.

## Release history must retain published tags
- Before retrying a release that reports `tag already exists`, check whether
  the published tag is an ancestor of the release branch. Rewritten history
  can leave a tag unreachable and make semantic-release calculate an existing
  version again.
- A failed release can already have pushed its generated commit. Fetch and
  inspect remote state before retrying; do not delete/repoint published tags
  or force-push release history. Any ancestry repair needs explicit review.
- Verify publication and alert resolution directly; a green workflow or an
  empty default-branch alert listing does not prove a PR alert is fixed.
  For a supplied CodeQL alert, inspect its specific ID and PR instance state.

## Device QA evidence has limits
- Record the exact input version/code, explicitly selected bundle (`MPP`),
  enabled patches, package ID, device, and signing setup. Multiple local
  bundles can exist; do not assume a helper selected the newest one.
- Existing-session behavior, fresh login, and renamed-package login are
  separate checks. Coexistence with a patched app does not establish
  coexistence with stock-signed upstream.
- Missing ad labels do not prove ad content was removed. Combine changing
  feed content and visual checks with before/after crash-buffer inspection;
  a few clean scrolls are a smoke test, not comprehensive coverage.
- Preserve user sessions. Ask before logout, clearing data, or replacing an
  installed app signed with another key. Let the user enter credentials.
- UI dumps and logs can contain account/feed data. Keep them outside the
  repository; temporary files may disappear and are not durable evidence.

## Respect the local toolchain
- Use tools already on `PATH`. `ANDROID_HOME` identifies the SDK for builds,
  independently of executable lookup; do not re-export it when SDK discovery
  is already configured. If a tool is missing, ask before installing it.
- Check the installed CLI's help when flags fail. Morphe Desktop 1.15.0 has
  no `options-create -t` or `patch --purge`; patch temporary files are purged
  by default. Keep errors visible when diagnosing helper failures.
- Inspect keystore aliases rather than guessing capitalization; keytool-made
  stores may contain lowercase `morphe`. Test keys must stay out of Git and
  cannot update an existing installation signed with another key.

## The extension `.mpe` is a build artifact, not a source file
- `extendWith("extensions/extension.mpe")` resolves relative to the patch
  working dir (repo root), but the extension module only emits
  `extensions/extension/build/morphe/extensions/extension.mpe`.
- `:patches:copyExtensionMpe` bridges the gap automatically and
  `:patches:verifyExtensionMpe` fail-fasts when the dex is missing
  (`extendWith` is a load-time reference, so the bundle builds fine without
  it — the failure would otherwise surface on-device). `buildAndroid`
  depends on both; CI runs the verify step explicitly. The repo-root copy
  stays git-ignored.
- Never commit `extensions/extension.mpe` or `analysis/` (see
  `scripts/clean-analysis.sh`).

## Risky patches default off
- A patch that can break core flows (login, providers, push) ships
  `default = false` and earns opt-in status with a WARNING in its description.
  Precedent: Change package name (renaming breaks package+cert-bound SSO).
- `PatchesListShapeTest` guards the default, so a regression fails CI.

## Version drift is routine, not an incident
- Pin exact `AppTarget` versions plus the tested `versionCode`
  (`Constants.TESTED_VERSION_CODE`) — same version *name* from different
  mirrors can carry different version *codes* (APKMirror vs APKPure).
- `FingerprintSurfaceTest` pins the obfuscated surface so the next app update
  fails loudly with a re-hunt pointer instead of silently dead patches.
- Per-update routine lives in `docs/qa-checklist.md` §4 (recon → re-hunt →
  device pass → update pin). Worst case for a missed drift is ads returning,
  never a broken feed — keep it that way (reflection wrapped, no-ops on mismatch).
