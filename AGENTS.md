# Agent Instructions

## Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `patches/` | Patch + fingerprint sources; builds `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp` |
| `extensions/extension/` | Companion extension source; builds `extensions/extension.mpe` |
| `scripts/` | Helper scripts (APK recon, re-patch, release staging, cleanup) |
| `docs/` | Contributor docs (setup, development, release, QA) |
| `config/` | Static-analysis config (`detekt.yml`) |
| `analysis/` | Gitignored local APK analysis scratch |

## Commands

| Task | Command |
| ---- | ------- |
| Verify | Follow [canonical verification](docs/development.md#verify) |
| Test single class | `./gradlew :patches:test --tests "<class>" --no-daemon` (extension: `:extensions:extension:testDebugUnitTest --tests "<class>"`) |
| Build patches bundle | `./gradlew buildAndroid` → `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp` |
| Re-patch + sign an APK | `bash scripts/repatch.sh <app.apkm> [out.apk]` (env overrides: see `docs/cli.md`) |
| Stage a release | Follow [release staging](docs/release.md#staging-a-release) |

## Key Conventions

- Branching and publishing: follow the [release process](docs/release.md).
- Generated-file ownership: follow [release rules](docs/release.md#rules).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: user-visible app changes only, bullets under `## Unreleased` only; never touch versioned entries.
- Risky-patch defaults and warnings: follow [patch authoring rules](docs/patch-development.md#file-layout).
