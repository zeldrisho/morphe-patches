## Unreleased

### ✨ New Features
* **Zalo - Disable ads:** Initial patch for `26.08.01` — forces the Adtima offline gates closed, always drops admob/dfp/ima from the supported-network map, and reports limit-ad-tracking opted-out without calling the Play API.
* **Zalo - Disable sponsored placements:** Initial patch for `26.08.01` — forces the Story/community ad-enable flags off at their config reads (normal content path kept; server-stitched or OA-message promos may remain).
* **Zalo - Remove AD_ID permission:** Initial patch for `26.08.01` — strips the advertising-id manifest entries (in-app readers fall back to "unknown"); pairs with the limit-ad-tracking opt-out now in Disable Zalo ads.
* **Zalo - Filter promo notifications:** Initial patch for `26.08.01` — drops Timeline/Stories and Zalo Video pushes in the push dispatcher; message, call, friend-request and birthday notifications are untouched.
